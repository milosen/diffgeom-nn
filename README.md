# Understanding "Principles of Riemannian Geometry in Neural Networks" by Michael Hauser and Asok Ray

## Topics to look into
* geomstat + pytorch?
* understanding dimensionality reduction
    - locally linear embedding
    - why euclidean metric in output space
* lie group actions on fibre bundles
* submersion / immersion of manifold
* connection (principal bundle)
* residual neural networks

## Resources on differential geometry and lie groups
* nice intro to lie groups and lie algebras: https://www.liealgebrasintro.com/publications
* great theoretical physics blog: http://jakobschwichtenberg.com/
